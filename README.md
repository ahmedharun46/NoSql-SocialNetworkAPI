# NoSql-SocialNetworkAPI

What was my goal?

Your Challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

What I learned

How to use mongoDB syntax. More practice in creating models. More practices in creating routes and controllers. Using syntax findOneAnd Update for my controllers. Getting more experience in using Insomia expecially using post to seed the data.
